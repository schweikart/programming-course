# Programming course at KIT
I took the programming course at KIT in winter semester 2019 / 2020 as part of my computer 
science studies.
This repository contains my submissions for the final exercises in that year.
I am publishing my submissions and grades in hope that future programming students at KIT find 
them useful, as it is difficult to find good examples of previous tasks.

## Grading
| Exercise                           | Grade         | Comment                                                                                                            |
